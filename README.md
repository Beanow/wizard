# SFOSC wizard

[![Greater Good Affirmation](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation/assets/images/badge.svg)](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation)

This is a subproject by SFOSC.
The same [Social Contract](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/blob/master/SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md)
and governance applies as can be found in the [main repository](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc).

## Goal

This wizard is intended to be an **educational journey** through the major themes to consider
when trying to build a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community of your own.
We'll provide **context and further reading** for each of these themes to help in this journey.

The output of the wizard will be an overview of your choices and a set of documents that you can
use directly for the project, for example a software license, [social contract](https://sfosc.org/social-contracts/),
[code of conduct](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and so on.

The wizard _will not aim to be neutral_ in any way, but should reflect SFOSC principles and community views.

## Current status: scaffolding

We're in the process of setting up this subproject.

Please feel free to join in defining the initial goals and roadmap.
You can also help with choosing tools, workflow, structure and so on for this repository.

Both of which you can best do through GitHub issues and/or pull requests on this repository.
